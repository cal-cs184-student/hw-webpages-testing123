		<h2>Overview</h2>
		The purpose of this homework assignment was to explore and implement various computer graphics algorithms and data structures, including Bezier curves and surfaces, triangle meshes, and the half-edge data structure. In this project, we implemented key techniques such as de Casteljau’s algorithm for 1D and 2D Bezier curves, the calculation of area-weighted vertex normals, edge flip and split operations, and Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling. Throughout these tasks, we applied our understanding of geometric concepts and data structures to manipulate and refine 3D models, specifically focusing on improving mesh quality and achieving smoother, more visually accurate results. 
		
		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>1D de Casteljau's algorithm uses linear interpolation with t (a value indicating how much each point weighs in the interpolation) 
			successively to until we arrive at a single point which lies on the Bezier curve. To implement this, we implemeted the 
			<code>evaluate_step</code> function which performs one step of linear interpolation between the pairs of points given in <code>points</code>.</p>

			<code>
				float x = (1 - t)*points[i].x + t*points[i+1].x; <br><br>
      			float y = (1 - t)*points[i].y + t*points[i+ 1].y;
			</code>

		<p>Here is the de Casteljau algorithm applied to a 6 control points -- showing each recursive step until the point on the bezier curve (red point). </p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		Like the spec mentions, we implemented Bezier surfaces. We used the same de Casteljau algorithm for each of the
		rows of <code>controlPoints</code> to evaluate the point on the Bezier curve, giving us the control points on the 
		"moving" Bezier curve. Then we took those control points points and performed de Casteljau's algorithm on them to 
		get the final point on the Bezier surface. 
		<br><br>
			
		We implemented <code>evaluateStep</code> the same as task 1, except with 
		the additional z coordinate. We implemented <code>evaluate1D</code> to continue calling <code>evaluateStep</code> until 
		we get the final point on the Bezier curve. Finally, we implemented <code>evaluate</code> to call <code>evaluate1D</code> 
		for each row of control points to get the control points for the "moving" Bezier curve, calling <code>evaluate1D</code> on that 
		set of control points on last time to arrive at the point on the Bezier surface.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		We implemented area-weighted vertex normals by first grabbing the 3 vertices that make up the current face, calculating the cross-product between two edges to get the normal of the face and also computed the area. Then we simply added to a running sum of area-weighted normals. Finally, to get to the next edge, we took the twin half edge on the other sid (this face also contains the vertex by definition), until we arrive at a half-edge we've seen before, in which case we are done, and return the area-weighted normals sum in unit vector form.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		For the edge flip operation, I first identified the two faces, four vertices, and associated halfedges around the edge to be flipped. The goal was to rewire the connections while preserving the mesh’s integrity. I reassigned the halfedges to point to the opposite vertices basically flipping the edge. The adjacency relationships between halfedges, edges, and faces were updated to maintain the consistency (for example, a halfedge pointing away from a particular vertex connected to that new associated vertex). When debugging my code, I found drawing and visualizing the faces as extremely helpful. Using this, I methodically got to check each step against the picture.

		<p>In this flipped teapot, I flipped 2 columns of meshes. Specifically, note how I flipped some edges in the second and third column from the left.</p>

		</div>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		I first identified the key elements involved, including the halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces connected to the edge being split. Then I created a new vertex at the midpoint of the edge and created three new edges, four new halfedges, and two new faces to maintain the mesh structure. After that, I updated the connectivity by reassigning halfedge pointers to ensure proper traversal and worked on linking the new elements correctly. I also made sure to update the new vertex’s halfedge pointer and also marked the newly introduced edges as <code>isNew = true</code>, except for the two halves of the original edge which were reused.
		An issue I dealt with was edges disappearing due to incorrect assignments. Like part 4, I drew out the full diagram of connections and went step by step to check all assignments. It took quite a few tries to retrace through all my steps -- including some hard restarts -- before it started to work.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		I iterated through all existing edges to compute new vertex positions based on the Loop subdivision weighting scheme and then then inserted new vertices at the midpoints of each edge. Next, I updated the positions of the original vertices using the loop subdivision formula, which averages neighboring vertex positions with the weights. Then I split all original edges and flipped as necessary.
		As for things I observed when running this, sharp corners and edges significantly smoothed out because the new vertices all shifted to the average position. You can most observe this 
		
		
		Initially, the cube was a simple, symmetrical shape with sharp edges and corners. After a few iterations of Loop subdivision, I observed that the cube became increasingly asymmetric with edges and vertices moving out of alignment. This is because loop subdivision smooths the geometry by averaging vertex positions, which causes the sharp corners to round out and distort over time. 
		To make the cube subdivide symmetrically, I found that you can pre-process it by performing edge flips and splits at strategic locations. Specifically, you should focus on the edges that connect opposite corners of the cube, as these tend to cause asymmetry when subdivided. By splitting these diagonal edges, you create more evenly distributed geometry, which helps maintain the overall shape during subdivision. I also did edge flips on the edges on the face of the cube to help balance the mesh. Flipping the edges ensures that the geometry is more uniform which prevents distortion in the corners and edges after multiple subdivision iterations.

		<p>After applying edge flips and splits to balance the mesh and topology of the cube, the upsampling ended up being more symmetric.</p>
